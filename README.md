This Repo is largely to share code across several libraries being developed
by the Google Chrome DevRel team.

At the moment this serves as an example project of how to set things up
but will also make certain files available that can be required in and used
within unit tests.

## NPM Scripts

You can view the default automated tests with the following npm scripts.

Run the automated tests:

    npm run test

Run the browser tests yourself:

    npm run browser-tests
